## Ways We’ve Optimized Our Application
1. Minifying our code
2. Removing our background header image for faster first view
3. Creating lighter, reduced resolution images for mobile users to view
4. Included Manifest to make a more seamless progressive web app

## Looking Forward, Some More Todo’s Beyond This Class:
1. TODO: Add a Service Worker for a better user experience & lightning fast page loads
2. TODO: Enforce chronological ordering of images on the home screen
3. TODO: Find better way to reduce image resolution without losing quality
4. TODO: Use client-side compression/decompression of images to reduce network utilization
5. TODO: More attractive user experience without performance drawback
